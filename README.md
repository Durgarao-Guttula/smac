# Statistical Mechanics and Computations
Code I have written for course: *Statistical Mechanics and Computations*
 and also to familiarize myself with _git_. Includes exercises from the textbook
*Statistical Mechanics: Algorithms and Computations,* by *Werner Krauth*.

## Chapter 1 Monte Carlo Methods

### Section 1.1
* 1.1 Implement Algorithm 1.1. Plot error and investigate relationship with N.
 * direct-plot.py
* 1.2 Implement Algorithm 1.2.Plot error and rejection rate.
 * markov-pi.py
* 1.3 Store state in file
 * direct.py
 * smacfiletoken.py

### Section 1.2
* 1.9 Sample permutations
 *  permutation.py
 * permutation-test.py
 * permutation-histogram.py
